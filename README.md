# Hey there! 👋 I'm Marvin!

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Virginia, on track to graduate in May 2026. I'm really into the world of embedded systems – things like designing circuit boards (PCB layout) and making hardware and software work together smoothly.

I'm also proud to be a QuestBridge National Scholar and have made the Dean's List three times (Fall 2022, Spring 2024, and Fall 2024). At UVA, I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and also diving into the world of data with a Data Science minor.
